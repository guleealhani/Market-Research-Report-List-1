<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concentrating Table Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Deck</li><li>Double Deck</li><li>Triple Deck</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concentrating tables are mineral processing equipment used for gravity separation in mining. They come in three market types: single deck, double deck, and triple deck. A single deck table processes material on a flat surface, suitable for smaller operations. Double deck tables offer enhanced efficiency by enabling separation of two different particle sizes simultaneously. Triple deck tables maximize efficiency further by accommodating three size fractions, making them ideal for larger, more complex mining operations where higher throughput and recovery rates are essential.</p></p>
