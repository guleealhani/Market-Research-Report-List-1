<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Femoral Stem Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented</li><li>Non-Cemented</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The femoral stem market is divided into two primary types: cemented and non-cemented femoral stems. Cemented stems are fixed using bone cement, providing immediate stability and support for patients with poor bone quality. In contrast, non-cemented stems rely on biological fixation, allowing the bone to grow into the stemâ€™s surface over time. The choice between these types often depends on factors like patient age, activity level, and bone condition, influencing outcomes in total hip arthroplasty.</p></p>
